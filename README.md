# Anti-UAV
Served as a large-scale multi-modal benchmark, Anti-UAV drives the future research on the frontiers of tracking UAVs in the wild. With the above innovations and contributions, we have organized the CVPR 2020 Workshop on the 1st Anti-UAV Challenge. These contributions together significantly benefit the community.
